This project aims to assess the impact of the Syrian Civil War on cropland in both Syria and neighboring countries such as Turkey.

Our empirical analysis employs large datasets constructed from [satellite imagery](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MCD12Q1) as well as georeferenced data on violence and population displacement. You may access an interactive version of our maps through our [visualization tool](https://javierparada.github.io/). 

We find significant cropland abandonment on the Syrian side of the border, especially in Aleppo and Ar-Raqqah governorates. In parallel, the Turkish side gains similar amounts of cropland, especially in Sanliurfa and Mardin provinces. We are currently working on exploring the mechanisms behind these changes in land cover, including (i) proximity to violent events from [Uppsala Conflict Data Program](https://ucdp.uu.se) data and (ii) population movements and data on refugees and IDPs to explain cropland gains in Turkey.
