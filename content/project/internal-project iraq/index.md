This project aims to compare land use type changes between ISIS-controlled areas and non-ISIS controlled areas in Iraq.

Our empirical analysis employs large datasets constructed from [satellite imagery](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MCD12Q1) as well as georeferenced data on violence and population displacement. You may access an interactive version of our maps through our [visualization tool](https://javierparada.github.io/). 

We find significant cropland abandonment around Mosul in Nineveh Governorate. In contrast, we find new croplands have been developed on the margins of existing croplands in Erbil and Kirkuk governorates. We are currently working on exploring the mechanisms behind these changes in land cover, including (i) proximity to violent events from [Uppsala Conflict Data Program](https://ucdp.uu.se) data and ISIS territorial control and (ii) population movements and data on refugees and IDPs.
